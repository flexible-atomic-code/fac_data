# Atomic Data Sets generated by FAC codes

In this repository, we keep example input files and their result by fac=1.1.4.


## Atomic data generated by FAC codes

The following lists have the link to the files of energy levels, radiative transition rates, Collisional excitation cross sections, radiative recombination and photoionization cross sections, autoionization rates and Collisional ionization cross sections of Helium.

Each ASCII file contains values per ion stage NE(Number of Electron=2 for neutral atom) of element Helium :

+ \*.ai : Autoionization rates produced by fac.AITable
+ \*.ce : Collisional excitation cross sections produced by fac.CETable
+ \*.ci : Collisional ionization cross sections produced by fac.CITable
+ \*.en : Energy levels produced by the function fac.Structure
+ \*.rr : Radiative recombination and photoionization cross sections produced by fac.RRTable
+ \*.tr : Radiative transition rates produced by fac.TransitionTable

### [Helium dataset](He)
### [Lithium dataset](Li)
### [Beryllium dataset](Be)


## Spectral data generated by built-in collisional radiative model

+ \*.sp : Energy interval and intensity

### [Helium dataset](He)
### [Lithium dataset](Li)
### [Beryllium dataset](Be)
